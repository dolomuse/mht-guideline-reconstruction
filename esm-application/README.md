# ESM Framework Application to MHT

## How Evidence-Selective Medicine Explains MHT Guideline Persistence

This section documents how the six-level Evidence-Selective Medicine (ESM) framework explains the 23-year persistence of restrictive MHT guidelines despite contradictory evidence.

### The Six Levels Applied to MHT

**Level 1 - Methodological Asymmetry**: 
- WHI receives minimal scrutiny despite major flaws
- Modern evidence receives heightened scrutiny despite stronger methodology

**Level 2 - Reporting Asymmetry**: 
- WHI breast cancer finding reported as definitive harm despite statistical nonsignificance
- Contradictory findings relegated to appendices

**Level 3 - Category Error**: 
- WHI findings extrapolated to all formulations despite pharmacological differences

**Level 4 - Semantic Obfuscation**: 
- "Progestin" collapses bioidentical progesterone and synthetic progestins with opposite effects

**Level 5 - Institutional Commitment Architecture**: 
- Organizations maintain restrictive guidelines to avoid acknowledging decades of failure

**Level 6 - Ethical Compartmentalization**: 
- Informed consent principles endorsed but not applied to MHT

## Geographic Divergence Demonstrates Institutional Selectivity

### European Guidelines (Evidence-Responsive)
- International Menopause Society (2016): Rejects "lowest dose, shortest duration"
- **All cite DOPS cardiovascular benefits**

### U.S. Guidelines (Institutionally Entrenched)
- ACOG, NAMS, Endocrine Society: Maintain restrictions
- **None cite DOPS despite 2012 publication**

**Conclusion**: Divergence reflects institutional mechanisms, not interpretive variation

## Real-Time Documentation: November 2025 FDA Reversal

**Prediction**: Organizations will prioritize institutional protection

**Observation**: As of December 2025, no guideline reviews announced

**This validates the ESM framework's explanatory power.**
